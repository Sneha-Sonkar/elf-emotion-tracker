# 🧝‍♀️ Elf Emotion Tracker ✨

A cozy workshop of feelings, cocoa, and glitter.  
This playful web app lets you **create multiple elves**, customize their roles and looks, and track their moods through tiny daily events.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **Multiple Elf Profiles** – switch between elves with a dropdown, or add new ones.
- **Custom Roles & Looks** – each role (Toy Painter, Cookie Engineer, Reindeer Wrangler, etc.) comes with a unique avatar style. You can override the look manually too.
- **Mood Tracking** – elves’ moods shift based on events, sliders (energy, glitter, coziness), and chaos rolls.
- **Dynamic Avatar** – eyes widen, mouths smile or frown, and accessories change with role/look.
- **Daily Log** – every event and diary snapshot is recorded in a cozy journal.
- **Reset & Snapshot** – reset elves to default or write diary entries with one click.

## 🎉 Why It’s Fun
- It’s whimsical and interactive — every click changes your elf’s mood in surprising ways.
- You can role‑play different elf personalities and see how they react to cocoa breaks, glitter shortages, or reindeer pranks.
- The diary entries make it feel like your elves are writing their own little stories.
- It’s cozy, playful, and perfect for sparking joy during the holidays (or anytime you need a smile).

## 🌟 My Hackathon Story
This project is extra special because it’s my **first time participating in a hackathon**.  
The experience has been chill, supportive, and gave me the space to be what I want to be — with full creative freedom. That freedom let me design something magical, personal, and joyful, and it made the hackathon feel less like a competition and more like a celebration of creativity.
